## Parsed text

.txt files are saved on the Linstat server which you can access on your own computer as a [network drive](https://kb.wisc.edu/sscc/95802) or via the [Winstat VPN](https://kb.wisc.edu/sscc/working-from-home-or-other-remote-locations).
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figs", "winstat.png"))
```


## Counts of total speeches 

Because the parsed .txt files are saved in subfolders by year/icpsr, counts per member per year are just the number of files in each folder (see [code/count_speeches.R](https://github.com/judgelord/cr/blob/master/code/count_speeches.R)) 

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# from code/count_speeches.R
load(here('data', 'd_count.Rdata'))

# from voteview 
load(here('data', 'members.Rdata'))

# join speech counts with voteview 
d <- d_count %>% left_join(members)

d %<>% filter(year < 2021, chamber %in% c("House", "Senate"))

# name + district strings for display
d %<>% mutate(name_district = bioname %>% str_remove(",.*") %>% str_to_title() %>% paste(cqlabel)) %>% 
  mutate(district_name = cqlabel %>% str_c(bioname, sep = ": ") %>% str_remove_all(",.*|\\(|\\)"))
```


### Most speeches per year 
```{r}
d %>% 
  select(year, name_district, icpsr, n_speeches) %>% 
  arrange(-n_speeches) %>% kablebox()
```

### The Wisconsin delegation
```{r wi, fig.height=11}
d %>% 
  filter(state_abbrev == "WI",!is.na(year)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = n_speeches, y = district_name, fill = nominate.dim1) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap("year", scales = "free_y", ncol = 2) +
  labs(y = "", x  = "Total Number of Speeches") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = muted("blue"), high = muted("red"), mid = "grey80")
```

### Average speeches per year for members of the House

```{r reps}

## Counts of sections by type

###  Types: legislation, business, process, and other

From `code/count_speeches.R`, saved as `data/d_meta.Rdata`

```
legislation_strings <- "ACT|BILL|RESOLUTION|AMENDMENT|EARMARK|APPROPRIATIONS|AUTHORIZATION|BUDGET|SPONSORS|WITHDRAWAL|PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED"

business_strings <- "PRAYER|PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE|MORNING BUSINESS|MESSAGE|PRIVILEGES OF THE|CONDEMING|APPOINTMENT|NOMINATION|CONFIRMATION|REPORT|PETITION|MEMORIAL|COMMUNICATION| MONTH|SCHEDULE|LEAVE OF ABSENCE|GENERAL LEAVE|ELECTING|RESIGNATION|MOMENT OF SILENCE"

```

```{r}
# clean up headers into type and subtype 
load(here("data", "d_meta.Rdata"))

d_meta %>% count(type) %>% kablebox() 
```

### Subtypes
```{r}
d_meta %>% count(type, subtype, sort = T) %>% kablebox() 
```

### Type = "Other"
```{r}

```


## Counts of speeches mentioning district

Subset of speeches that mention "district" `code/count_district.R`, saved as `data/d_district.Rdata`.

Average speeches per congress mentioning "district" from the Wisconsin delegation:

```{r}
load(here("data","d_district.Rdata"))

# average per member of the WI 
d_district %>% 
  filter(state_abbrev == "WI") %>% 
  group_by(congress, icpsr, state_abbrev) %>% 
  count(name = "district_mentions") %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(icpsr) %>% 
  summarise(average_district_mentions = mean(district_mentions)) %>% 
  left_join(members %>% distinct(bioname, icpsr)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = average_district_mentions, y = bioname) +
  geom_col()
```

## Sentences mentioning "district"
from the Wisconsin delegation 

```{r}
load(here("data", "d_district_sentences_wi.Rdata"))

# clean up strings for easier reading
d_district_sentences_wi %<>% 
  mutate(district_sentences = district_sentences %>% 
           str_remove("_* </pre></body></html>") %>%
           str_remove_all("\\$|`"))
  
# a sample of sentences from 100 speeches
d_district_sentences_wi %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(district_sentences, "district court")) %>%
  distinct(type, subtype, district_sentences, url) %>% 
  select(type, subtype, district_sentences, url) %>% 
  kablebox()
```

### Sentences mentioning "my district"

```{r}
# a sample of sentences from 100 speeches
d_district_sentences_wi %>% 
  filter(str_detect(district_sentences, "my district")) %>%
  distinct(type, subtype, district_sentences, url) %>% 
  select(type, subtype, district_sentences, url) %>% 
  kablebox()
```

> TODO: (1) Refine this to exclude "district court" etc. and (2) include other district-referencing language
