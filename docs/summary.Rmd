## Parsed text

.txt files are saved on the Linstat server which you can access on your own computer as a [network drive](https://kb.wisc.edu/sscc/95802) or via the [Winstat VPN](https://kb.wisc.edu/sscc/working-from-home-or-other-remote-locations).

.txt file names  look like this: "CREC-2010-11-16-pt1-PgH7478-000533-14413.txt"

They contain 

- the date ("2010-11-16") 

- the page number ("pt1-PgH7478"--"H" because it is the House section, Senate is "S" and Extensions of Remarks is "E")  

- a speech ID assigned per day by the parser. "000533" means that this was the 533rd "speech" of the day (recall that "speeches" include simple speech acts like "I yield" as well as headers and other text that is not spoken parsed as seperate files)

- and finally, the members ICPSR ID. "14413" is Representative Norman Dicks. 


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figs", "winstat.png"))
```


## Counts of total speeches 

Because the parsed .txt files are saved in subfolders by year/icpsr, counts per member per year are just the number of files in each folder (see [code/count_speeches.R](https://github.com/judgelord/cr/blob/master/code/count_speeches.R)) 

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# from code/count_speeches.R
load(here('data', 'd_count.Rdata'))

# from voteview 
load(here('data', 'members.Rdata'))

# join speech counts with voteview 
d <- d_count %>% left_join(members)

d %<>% filter(year < 2021, chamber %in% c("House", "Senate"))

# name + district strings for display
d %<>% mutate(name_district = bioname %>% str_remove(",.*") %>% str_to_title() %>% paste(cqlabel)) %>% 
  mutate(district_name = cqlabel %>% str_c(bioname, sep = ": ") %>% str_remove_all(",.*|\\(|\\)"))
```


### Most speeches per year 
```{r}
d %>% 
  select(year, name_district, icpsr, n_speeches) %>% 
  arrange(-n_speeches) %>% kablebox()
```

---

### The Wisconsin delegation
```{r wi, fig.height=11}
d %>% 
  filter(state_abbrev == "WI",!is.na(year)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = n_speeches, y = district_name, fill = nominate.dim1) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap("year", scales = "free_y", ncol = 2) +
  labs(y = "", x  = "Total Number of Speeches") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = muted("blue"), high = muted("red"), mid = "grey80")
```


---

### Average speeches per year for members of the House

```{r reps}
# as a table per member 
d %>% 
  filter(chamber == "House") %>%
  group_by(name_district) %>% 
  summarise(average_speeches = mean(n_speeches) %>% round() ) %>% 
  arrange(-average_speeches) %>% 
  kablebox()

# as a table per state
d %>% 
  filter(chamber == "House") %>%
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(average_speeches = mean(n_speeches) %>% round() ) %>% 
  kablebox()



# as a map
states <- map_data("state") %>% rename(state = region)

d %>% 
  filter(chamber == "House") %>%
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(average_speeches = mean(n_speeches) ) %>% 
  left_join(states) %>% 
  group_by(subregion) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = average_speeches) ) +
  geom_polygon(color = "white") + 
  theme_void()


d %>% 
  filter(chamber == "House") %>%
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  summarise(average_speeches = mean(n_speeches) ) %>% 
  left_join(states) %>% 
  group_by(subregion) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = average_speeches) ) +
  geom_polygon(color = "white") + 
  theme_void() +
  facet_wrap("year")
```

## Counts of speeches by type

This is similar to counts of congressional record sections by type [here](), but now parsed by speaker. This means that "legislation" counts are much higher becasue each section of legislation contains many speakers. 

###  Types: legislation, business, process, and other

From `code/count_speeches.R`, saved as `data/d_meta.Rdata`

```
legislation_strings <- "ACT|BILL|RESOLUTION|AMENDMENT|EARMARK|APPROPRIATIONS|AUTHORIZATION|BUDGET|SPONSORS|WITHDRAWAL|PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL OF A RULE SUBMITTED"

business_strings <- "PRAYER|PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE|MORNING BUSINESS|MESSAGE|PRIVILEGES OF THE|CONDEMING|APPOINTMENT|NOMINATION|CONFIRMATION|REPORT|PETITION|MEMORIAL|COMMUNICATION| MONTH|SCHEDULE|LEAVE OF ABSENCE|GENERAL LEAVE|ELECTING|RESIGNATION|MOMENT OF SILENCE"
  
process_strings <- "RECOGNIZED FOR [0-9] MINUTES|ANNOUNCEMENT|RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME|UNANIMOUS CONSENT|ADJOURNMENT|EXECUTIVE SESSION|PETITION| ORDER|^ORDER|MOTION|RECESS|CALENDAR|RECOGNITION|WELCOMING|OATH |SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE|MEASURES DISCHARGED|INTENT TO OBJECT"
```

```{r}
# clean up headers into type and subtype 
load(here("data", "d_meta.Rdata"))

d_meta %>% count(type) %>% kablebox() 
```

### Subtypes
```{r}
d_meta %>% count(type, subtype, sort = T) %>% kablebox() 
```

### Type = "Other"
```{r}

count(d_meta %>% filter(type == "other"), subtype, sort = T) %>% kablebox()
```


## Counts of speeches mentioning district

The subset of speeches that mention "district" from `code/count_district.R` is saved as `data/d_district.Rdata`.

For more accurate and faster counts of district-oriented behavior etc., I am excluding two types of speeches:

- speeches under 1000 characters (always procedural, as far as I can tell)

- speeches that appear to be procedural or chamber business based their header text. 

Average speeches per congress mentioning "district" from the Wisconsin delegation:

```{r}
load(here("data","d_district.Rdata"))

# average per member of the WI 
d_district %>% 
  filter(state_abbrev == "WI") %>% 
  group_by(congress, icpsr, state_abbrev) %>% 
  count(name = "district_mentions") %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(icpsr) %>% 
  summarise(average_district_mentions = mean(district_mentions)) %>% 
  left_join(members %>% distinct(bioname, icpsr)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = average_district_mentions, y = bioname) +
  geom_col()
```

Average number speeches mentioning "district" for members of the House

```{r district-speeches-per-year}
# average speeches per house member
d_district %>% 
  left_join(members %>% distinct(icpsr, chamber, congress, state, state_abbrev)) %>% 
  filter(chamber == "House") %>%
  count(icpsr, state, year, name = "district_speeches", .drop = FALSE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  summarise(average_district_speeches = mean(district_speeches, na.rm = T) %>% replace_na(0)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # fill missing states with 0 
  full_join(distinct(states, state)) %>% 
  complete(year, state, fill = list(average_district_speeches = 0)) %>% 
  # Join in lat and long 
  left_join(states) %>% 
  group_by(subregion) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = average_district_speeches) ) +
  geom_polygon(color = "white") + 
  theme_void() +
  facet_wrap("year")
```

## Sentences mentioning "district"
from the Wisconsin delegation 

Excluding "district court" "their district" "their home district" "their state or district" "each/every district" "school district" etc.

```{r}
load(here("data", "d_district_sentences_wi.Rdata"))

# clean up strings for easier reading
d_district_sentences_wi %<>% 
  mutate(district_sentences = district_sentences %>% 
           str_remove("_* </pre></body></html>") %>%
           str_remove_all("\\$|`"))

to_exclude <- "district (court|attorney)|(each|every) (congressional |)district|their (congressional|home|state(s|) or|) district|school district|, districts|locality or congressional district"
  
# a sample of sentences from 100 speeches
d_district_sentences_wi %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(district_sentences, to_exclude)) %>%
  distinct(type, subtype, district_sentences, url) %>% 
  select(type, subtype, district_sentences, url) %>% 
  kablebox()
```

(Excluding `r to_exclude`)

### Sentences mentioning "my district"

Also including my/our district, my/our congressional district/ my/our community/communities, my/our home district etc. 

```{r}
to_include <- "(my|our)( own|) district|(my|our)( own|) congressional district|(my|our)( own|) communit|(my/our)( own|) home district|i represent a district|(my/our)( own|) constituent"

# a sample of sentences from 100 speeches
d_district_sentences_wi %>% 
  filter(str_detect(district_sentences, to_include)) %>%
  distinct(type, subtype, district_sentences, url) %>% 
  select(type, subtype, district_sentences, url) %>% 
  kablebox()
```
(Including only `r to_include`)

> TODO: (1) Refine this to exclude non-district-referenceing language and (2) include other district-referencing language
